# Locator

Locator is a custom [Craft CMS](https://www.craftcms.com) field type that uses the [GeoCodio](https://www.geocod.io) API to geocode addresses.  This plugin will save the address, latitude, and longitude for the location.

This field type is compatible with the matrix field type.

## Prerequisites

You must provide a [GeoCodio](https://www.geocod.io) API key in the plugin settings.
